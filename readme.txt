WordPress database tools for debugging.

== Description ==
These tools lets you do a quick backup of individual MySQL tables by duplication into the same database.
Useful for testing when you know only some tables will be changed so you don't have to save and restore the entire database.
Most useful for repeated testing, i.e. backup table(s), test, restore table(s), test, restore table(s), ... test, restore table(s), delete backup.
